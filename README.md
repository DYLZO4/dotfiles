A personal collection of configuration files for setting up a productive development environment. This repository includes my setup for:

- Neovim – Lua-based configuration with plugin manager, LSP support, and custom keymaps.
- tmux – Minimal and efficient terminal multiplexer config with sensible defaults.
- zsh – Aliases, environment variables, and other CLI productivity tools.

These files are intended to be symlinked into your home directory for easy version control and portability across systems.
